# **Skribify v0.1.6**

Skribify is a tool designed to transcribe and summarize video or audio content. The new v0.1.6 update brings several minor enhancements:

- Chunks are now moved to a designated directory, which is deleted after completion.
- Configuration settings are now moved to `config.py` for improved readability.
- The `.env` file is saved in the project root, not module root, when using Skribify as a package.
- Changed how some imports work to improve readability and efficacy.
  
  
Thanks for using Skribify!
